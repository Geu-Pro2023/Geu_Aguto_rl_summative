## 1. Project Overview

This project implements a reinforcement learning solution for cattle monitoring and theft prevention in rural South Sudan, addressing the critical problem of cattle raiding that causes significant economic and social disruption. The system simulates a herder agent navigating a 10x10 grid environment to register cattle at designated points and alert authorities when theft is detected. Two primary RL algorithms are compared: Deep Q-Network (DQN) as a value-based method and REINFORCE as a policy gradient method. The environment features dynamic obstacles (raiders), multiple objectives (registration and alerting), and sparse rewards that create a challenging multi-task learning scenario representative of real-world cattle monitoring challenges.

## 2. Environment Description

### 2.1 Agent(s)
The agent represents a cattle herder in rural South Sudan with the capability to navigate a 10x10 grid environment, register cattle at specific locations, and alert authorities when theft is detected. The agent has limited visibility of the environment state and must learn optimal policies for multi-objective tasks including cattle registration, theft detection, and raider avoidance. The agent's limitations include discrete movement actions, finite episode length (200 steps), and the requirement to physically reach specific locations to perform registration and alerting actions.

### 2.2 Action Space
The action space is discrete with 6 possible actions:
- **Action 0:** Move Up (decrease y-coordinate)
- **Action 1:** Move Down (increase y-coordinate)  
- **Action 2:** Move Left (decrease x-coordinate)
- **Action 3:** Move Right (increase x-coordinate)
- **Action 4:** Register Cattle (only effective at blue registration points)
- **Action 5:** Alert Authorities (only effective at yellow checkpoints)

This comprehensive action set covers all necessary behaviors for the cattle monitoring task, including navigation and task-specific actions for registration and alerting.

### 2.3 State Space
The state representation is a 15-dimensional continuous observation vector containing:
- **Agent position:** (x, y) coordinates [2 dimensions]
- **Cattle positions:** 3 cattle × 2 coordinates each [6 dimensions]
- **Raider positions:** 2 raiders × 2 coordinates each [4 dimensions]
- **Checkpoint status:** Binary indicators for 3 checkpoints [3 dimensions]

This observation provides the agent with essential spatial information while maintaining computational tractability. The state encoding uses normalized coordinates and binary flags to ensure consistent input scaling for neural network processing.

### 2.4 Reward Structure
The reward function is designed to encourage efficient task completion while penalizing undesirable behaviors:

**Mathematical Formulation:**
- R_step = -0.1 (efficiency incentive)
- R_register = +15 (cattle registration at blue points)
- R_alert = +20 (authority alert at yellow checkpoints when theft detected)
- R_false_alert = -2 (penalty for alerting without stolen cattle)
- R_raider_collision = -10 (safety penalty)
- R_mission_success = +50 (bonus for ≥2 registrations + ≥1 alert)
- R_timeout = -20 (penalty for exceeding 200 steps)

**Total Reward:** R_total = R_step + R_register + R_alert + R_false_alert + R_raider_collision + R_mission_success + R_timeout

### 2.5 Environment Visualization

The visualization uses Pygame rendering with distinct visual elements: green circles represent the agent (herder), brown circles represent cattle (red when stolen), red triangles represent raiders, blue squares represent registration points, and yellow squares represent checkpoints. The real-time visualization provides immediate feedback on agent behavior, entity positions, and task completion status.

## 3. Implemented Methods

### 3.1 Deep Q-Network (DQN)
The DQN implementation uses a discrete state approximation approach with Q-table storage for computational efficiency. The network architecture employs state discretization using the first 6 observation dimensions rounded to 1 decimal place, creating a manageable state space. Key features include experience replay with a buffer size of 50,000 transitions, target network updates every 1,000 steps, and ε-greedy exploration with linear decay from 1.0 to 0.05 over 10% of training. The Q-learning update rule follows: Q(s,a) ← Q(s,a) + α[r + γ max Q(s',a') - Q(s,a)] with learning rate α = 0.0001 and discount factor γ = 0.99.

### 3.2 REINFORCE (Policy Gradient Method)
The REINFORCE implementation uses a linear policy network with softmax action selection and Monte Carlo policy gradient updates. The network architecture consists of a single linear layer mapping the 15-dimensional state to 6 action logits, followed by softmax normalization for probability distribution. The policy gradient update follows: ∇θ J(θ) = E[∇θ log π(a|s) G_t] where G_t represents discounted returns. Key features include baseline subtraction using return normalization, gradient clipping for stability, and learning rate scheduling. The algorithm updates policy parameters after each complete episode using the REINFORCE gradient estimator with variance reduction through return standardization.

## 5. Hyperparameter Optimization

### 5.1 DQN Hyperparameters

| Hyperparameter | Optimal Value | Summary |
|----------------|---------------|---------|
| Learning Rate | 0.0001 | Conservative learning rate provided stable Q-value updates without oscillations. Higher rates (0.001) caused instability, while lower rates (0.00001) resulted in extremely slow convergence. |
| Gamma (Discount Factor) | 0.99 | High discount factor emphasized long-term planning essential for multi-step cattle registration tasks. Lower values (0.9) led to myopic behavior and task failure. |
| Replay Buffer Size | 50,000 | Large buffer provided diverse experience sampling and reduced correlation between consecutive updates. Smaller buffers (10,000) showed higher variance in learning. |
| Batch Size | 32 | Balanced computational efficiency with gradient stability. Larger batches (64) showed marginal improvement but increased computational cost. |
| Exploration Strategy | ε-greedy (1.0→0.05) | Linear decay over 10% of training provided effective exploration-exploitation balance. Faster decay led to premature exploitation, slower decay hindered convergence. |
| Target Update Interval | 1000 steps | Frequent target updates maintained learning stability while preventing target network staleness. More frequent updates (500) caused instability. |

**Performance Impact:** The hyperparameter combination achieved mean reward of -59.5 ± 24.4 with stable learning curves and consistent performance across multiple runs.

### 5.2 REINFORCE Hyperparameters

| Hyperparameter | Optimal Value | Summary |
|----------------|---------------|---------|
| Learning Rate | 0.001 | Moderate learning rate balanced policy update magnitude with stability. Higher rates (0.01) caused policy collapse, lower rates (0.0001) resulted in slow convergence. |
| Gamma (Discount Factor) | 0.99 | High discount factor essential for long-horizon cattle monitoring tasks. Lower values reduced performance significantly due to short-sighted policy optimization. |
| Policy Network Architecture | Linear (15→6) | Simple linear mapping proved sufficient for the discrete action space. More complex architectures showed no improvement and increased computational overhead. |
| Baseline Method | Return Normalization | Standardizing returns (mean=0, std=1) significantly reduced gradient variance and improved learning stability compared to raw returns. |
| Gradient Clipping | None | No gradient clipping was necessary due to stable policy updates. The linear architecture and return normalization provided sufficient stability. |
| Episode Batch Size | 1 | Single episode updates provided immediate policy feedback. Larger batches showed no significant improvement in this environment. |

**Performance Impact:** The hyperparameter configuration achieved mean reward of -69.0 ± 35.9 with higher variance than DQN but maintained learning progress throughout training.

## 6. Conclusion and Discussion

**Performance Summary:** DQN demonstrated superior performance in the cattle monitoring environment with lower mean reward (-59.5 vs -69.0), reduced variance (24.4 vs 35.9), and better generalization capabilities. The value-based approach proved more sample-efficient and stable for this discrete action, multi-objective task.

**Algorithm Strengths:**
- **DQN:** Excellent sample efficiency, stable learning, robust generalization, and effective handling of discrete action spaces through Q-value approximation.
- **REINFORCE:** Direct policy optimization, natural exploration through stochastic policies, and theoretical guarantees for policy gradient convergence.

**Algorithm Weaknesses:**
- **DQN:** State discretization loses information, limited to discrete actions, and requires careful hyperparameter tuning for stability.
- **REINFORCE:** High variance gradients, sample inefficiency, and sensitivity to reward scaling and initial conditions.

**Environment-Specific Insights:** The sparse reward structure and multi-objective nature of cattle monitoring favored DQN's value-based approach, which effectively learned to balance registration and alerting tasks. The discrete action space aligned well with DQN's Q-value estimation, while REINFORCE's continuous policy representation was less advantageous.

**Future Improvements:** With additional resources, implementing Double DQN and Dueling Networks could further improve DQN performance, while adding baseline functions and advantage estimation could enhance REINFORCE stability. Environment modifications such as reward shaping and curriculum learning could benefit both algorithms. Integration with real-world data and deployment considerations would require additional robustness testing and safety constraints.

**Practical Applications:** This work demonstrates the feasibility of RL approaches for cattle monitoring systems in resource-constrained environments, providing a foundation for developing AI-assisted livestock management solutions in rural African contexts.
