# Cattle Verification and Theft Prevention RL System

## Project Overview

This project implements a comprehensive reinforcement learning system for cattle verification and theft prevention in South Sudan, addressing the critical issue of cattle raiding through biometric-based verification. The system trains and compares four different RL algorithms to navigate a complex grid environment, verify cattle identities, detect theft attempts, and prevent cattle raiding while maximizing mission rewards.

## Mission Context

**Background**: In South Sudan, cattle represent wealth, social status, and cultural identity. Cattle raiding causes significant economic loss and social instability. This RL system simulates a biometric verification environment where agents must:

- Navigate a 10x10 grid environment
- Verify cattle using biometric scanning (represented by reaching cattle positions)
- Reach verification stations to register verified cattle
- Avoid thieves who attempt to steal cattle
- Maximize rewards through successful verification and theft prevention

## Environment Description

### Custom Gymnasium Environment: `CattleVerificationEnv`

**State Space**: Dictionary observation containing:
- `agent`: Agent position (2D coordinates)
- `target`: Verification station position (2D coordinates) 
- `cattle`: 4 cattle positions (4x2 array)
- `thieves`: 2 thief positions (2x2 array)

**Action Space**: Discrete(4)
- 0: Move Up
- 1: Move Right  
- 2: Move Down
- 3: Move Left

**Reward Structure**:
- `-0.1`: Step penalty (encourages efficiency)
- `+5`: Verifying cattle (biometric scanning)
- `+10`: Detecting stolen cattle (cattle at thief location)
- `+20 × verified_count`: Reaching verification station with verified cattle
- `-50`: Getting caught by thieves (episode termination)

**Termination Conditions**:
- Agent reaches verification station with verified cattle (success)
- Agent caught by thieves (failure)
- Maximum steps reached

## Implemented Algorithms

### 1. Deep Q-Network (DQN) - Value-Based Method
**Hyperparameters & Justification**:
- Learning Rate: 1e-4 (Conservative for stable Q-learning updates)
- Buffer Size: 100,000 (Large buffer for diverse experience replay)
- Batch Size: 128 (Standard for neural network stability)
- Target Update Interval: 10,000 (Prevents target network instability)
- Exploration: ε-greedy (1.0 → 0.05) (Balanced exploration-exploitation)
- Gamma: 0.99 (Long-term reward consideration)

**Performance Impact**: Lower learning rate prevents Q-value instability, large buffer improves sample efficiency, ε-greedy ensures adequate exploration in sparse reward environment.

### 2. Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) - Policy Gradient Method
**Hyperparameters & Justification**:
- Learning Rate: 3e-4 (Higher than DQN for policy gradient updates)
- Steps per Update: 2,048 (Long rollouts for stable policy gradients)

- Epochs: 10 (Multiple updates per batch for efficiency)
- Clip Range: 0.2 (Prevents destructive policy updates)
- GAE Lambda: 0.95 (Bias-variance tradeoff in advantage estimation)

**Performance Impact**: Clipping prevents policy collapse, GAE reduces variance, longer rollouts provide stable gradients for complex environment.

### 3. Advantage Actor-Critic (A2C) - Actor-Critic Method
**Hyperparameters & Justification**:
- Learning Rate: 7e-4 (Highest for fast actor-critic convergence)
- Steps per Update: 5 (Short rollouts for frequent updates)
- Entropy Coefficient: 0.01 (Encourages exploration)
- GAE Lambda: 1.0 (Full Monte Carlo returns)
- Max Gradient Norm: 0.5 (Prevents gradient explosion)

**Performance Impact**: Higher learning rate enables faster convergence, entropy coefficient prevents premature convergence, short rollouts provide frequent feedback.

### 4. REINFORCE - Pure Policy Gradient Method
**Hyperparameters & Justification**:
- Learning Rate: 3e-4 (Standard for policy gradient methods)
- Gamma: 0.99 (Long-term reward consideration for episodic tasks)
- Baseline: Reward normalization (Critical for variance reduction)
- Episodes: 2,000 (Sufficient for policy convergence)
- Network: 2-layer MLP (128 hidden units) (Adequate capacity)

**Performance Impact**: Baseline normalization crucial for reducing high variance, sufficient episodes needed for stable policy learning in complex environment.
